### What is tic-tac-toe?

- Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3×3 grid -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe).

- In Mandarin (at least in Taiwan), we call this game '圈圈叉叉' while '圈 (chiuān)' means 'circles' and '叉 (chā)' means 'crosses'.
